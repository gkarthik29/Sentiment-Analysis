# Sentiment Analysis Using VADER
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool. VADER is particularly effective for analyzing sentiment in social media posts, product reviews, and other short text data by identifying the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment within text samples.

# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on text data using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. VADER is a pre-built model specifically designed to determine the sentiment expressed in text, with a focus on capturing social media sentiment.

# The Jupyter Notebook in this repository walks through:

- Loading and preprocessing text data.
- Analyzing sentiment using VADER.
- Displaying sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, and compound scores).
- Visualizing sentiment analysis results.

# Installation
To use the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

- nltk
- pandas
- matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

# Install dependencies
You can install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install nltk pandas matplotlib
```
# NLTK Setup
```
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-vader.git
cd sentiment-analysis-vader
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook sample-vader-sentiment-analysis.ipynb
```

Run the notebook to see the sentiment analysis workflow in action, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Sentiment analysis using VADER
- Visualization of sentiment scores

# Results
The notebook generates sentiment scores for text data, including:

- Positive Score:  - Degree of positivity in the text.
- Negative Score:  - Degree of negativity in the text.
- Neutral Score: - Degree of neutrality in the text.
- Compound Score: - Overall sentiment score.

# Example output:
```
Text: "I love this product!"
Sentiment Scores: {'pos': 0.636, 'neu': 0.364, 'neg': 0.0, 'compound': 0.8316}
```
